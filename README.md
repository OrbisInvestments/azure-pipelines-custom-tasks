# Orbis Azure Pipeline Tasks

Custom Azure Pipeline Tasks

## Dedupe Git Repositories Task

An Azure Pipelines task for deduplicating clones of Git repositories on self-hosted Windows agent servers.

### Build Status

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/orbisinvestments/Open%20Source/_apis/build/status/Azure%20Pipeline%20Custom%20Tasks/Centralize%20Git%20Repositories%20Task?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/orbisinvestments/Open%20Source/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Tested with Azure DevOps Server 2019 / Azure DevOps Services / TFS 2018 and self-hosted Windows Azure Pipelines Agent [v2.144.0](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/releases/tag/v2.144.0)

### Motivation

Given the scenario where multiple Azure Pipelines use the same Git repository as their source, the Azure Pipelines Agent will create a seperate clone of the repository for each of the pipelines it executes. For large repositories with many pipelines this can result in agent working directories that consume significant disk space. More details can be found in this issue here: [microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/1506](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/issues/1506)

A more efficient approach would be for the agent to share a single clone of the repository amongst all pipelines that use it.

The **Dedupe Git Repositories Task** stubs this behaviour by running a *post job execution* script that deduplicates the pipeline's repository clone and repoints its working directory at a shared clone. 

### Installation

Head over to the latest Dedupe Git Repositories [release](https://github.com/OrbisInvestments/azure-pipelines-custom-tasks/releases), then download and extract **DedupeGitRepos.zip** from the releaseâ€™s assets. 

Use [tfx](https://github.com/Microsoft/tfs-cli) to upload the extracted task to your account under a suitably permissioned identity or PAT:

`tfx login`
`tfx build tasks upload --task-path .`


### How to use

###  How it works

When executed the Dedupe Git Repositories Task will determine if the repository clone that is used by the pipeline is a *shared* clone. If not, then either:

1. the pipeline's clone is moved into a shared location (Agent.WorkFolder\g), if a clone for the same repository does not already exist. This becomes the *shared* clone. 

Or

2. the pipeline's clone is deleted if a clone in the shared location does already exist
    
Once this is done the task updates the pipeline's cached working directory configuration to point at the shared clone. The next time the pipeline is executed by the agent the pipeline will use the shared clone for its sources. 

To avoid concurrency issues shared clones are created [per-agent](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/issues/1506#issuecomment-381361454).
